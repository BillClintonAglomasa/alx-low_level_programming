This project (0x08 - Recursion) concentrates on using recursion to write simple recursion formulas .

1. 0-puts_recursion.c
This is a C function that prints a string, followed by a line.

2. 1-print_rev_recursion.c
This is a C function that that prints a string in reverse.

3. 2-strlen.c
This is a C function that returns the length of a string.

4. 3-factorial.c
This is a C function that returns the factorial of a given number.

5. 4-pow_recursion.c
This is a C function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

6. 5-sqrt_recursion.c
A C function that returns the natural square root of a number.

7. 6-is_prime_number.c
A C function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

8. 100-is_palindrome.c
A C function that returns i if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

10. 101-crackme_password.c
A C function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

12. main.h
A header file with the function prototype.

13. *-main.c
C files (executable).
