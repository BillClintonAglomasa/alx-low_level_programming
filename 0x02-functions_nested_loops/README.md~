This project concentrates of declaring variables and writing loops (if and while).

1. 0-positive_or_negative.c
This C program assigns a random number to n and prints out the stored variable
and whether it is positive, negative or zero.

2. 1-last_digit.c
This C program assigns a random number to n and prints the last digit of the
number stored in n.

3. 2-print_alphabet.c
This C program prints the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line.

4. 3-print_alphabets.c
This C program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by in uppercase
and followed by a new line.

5. 4-print_alphabt.c
This is a C program that prints alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
without the q and e using the putchar twice in the code.

6. 5-print_numbers.c
A C program that prints all the single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

7. 6-print_numberz.c

allowed to use variable of type char and to use putchar functon only twice.

8. 7-print_tebalpha.c
A C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using putchar
function only twice.

9. 8-print_basel16.c

new line using the putchar function thrice.

10. 9-print_comb.c
